title: How Political Science is a stepping stone to becoming a global citizen

description: Politics can sometimes seem the anathema of our times. With
  connotations such as graft and greed, the ability of politics to create
  resilient, equal and peaceful societies seems to be lost upon us. Even the
  Political Science NCERT textbook for Grade XI spends a part of its initial
  chapter explaining why politics has such a bad rap, and why that needs to
  change. How then can the study of politics help change its image and create
  purposeful and participative citizens?

In an increasingly polarised world, divided into echo chambers with cyberbalkanization, understanding politics becomes integral to finding reason within the recondite. Political Science covers a wide spectrum – from local democratic processes to global citizenship. The topics and issues covered in the subject can help learners navigate difficult conversations and socio-political contexts.

**From poles to perspective**

Politics teaches us that right and wrong depending on which side you view them from. It traverses the grey, relying on the complexities of the human condition to conceive right from wrong. Take the Cold War as an example. What seems to be a clear conflict between communism and capitalism is a lot deeper than that. Class discussions and research can reveal the complexities of the arenas of conflict, the difficulty in defining the conflict as merely ideological, the geo-strategic realities of the time and the effects of nuclear deterrence. Each of these dimensions will have different layers depending on the point of view. The fall of USSR may be blamed partly on undemocratic structures. While the post-Soviet conflicts blamed on ‘Shock Therapy’ lacking in strong democratic systems being built. On which side then lies the fault for the ensuing violence? 

It may seem that politics is all about taking extreme stands, a student of the subject will realize how untenable that is. Left, right, or centre leanings can come untethered as one begins unravelling the layers. When understanding globalisation from a political perspective, it may be easy to assume that the right favours open markets, and so will be open to globalisation. But the right also favours cultural conservativeness, which a globally heterogenous environment may deflect from. How then does one decide which side of the aisle they wish to be on? And on which side of the aisle the ‘other’ belongs?

These examples illustrate the critical dimension of political science which makes it an important subject to study. It helps build and comprehend perspective, especially important for young learners. With multidimensional perspectives, students grow up to become empathetic individuals and global citizens. The subject teaches them to refrain from rushing to judgement and instead debate, discuss and deliberate. It is important to point out here that a lot of this perspective building happens in the classroom discourse. The pedagogy we encourage in our school for example uses tools such as the Socratic Method to underscore no one point as being the ‘right’ one necessarily. Instead the focus is on elaborating upon and discussing the multiple points to broaden understanding.

**Contexts, concepts and critical thinking**

 21st century skills focus on creating aware learners who are able to think analytically and critically. They consider the nuances of issues and evaluate through deeper analysis and questioning. Political Science as a subject cultivates these very skills. The theories of state, justice, liberty, equality, all attempt to explore important concepts which affect our everyday existence. When discussing the Fundamental Right to free speech and expression, for example, students apply their understanding of freedom and liberty. Limitations on the freedom come from arguments such as the Harm Principle. Teaching and learning conceptually are the bedrock of the subject, as the same concept of liberty can span across generations, from slavery to sedition. 

The subject also shapes global thinkers and citizens. It spans across nations and by focussing on concepts, it can delve into distinct contexts. For example, when exploring citizen-state relations, one can look at the Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality in United States of America, as well as the protests against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in Nigeria. Both of these movements from 2020 are contextual to their time and region. However, both can be studied to understand power, authority and legitimacy.

**21st century skills and knowledge**

This ability of Political Science to be global and local, contemporary and anachronistic is unique. It sets the students of the subject apart as logical thinkers who also understand human emotion and motivation. A large part of this engagement is also dependent on collaborative learning and on personal learning pathways. In our classrooms, both are used to give students the choice to explore concepts using personal projects and research strands. Learning through group work also increases student voice, agency and creates better team players and future leaders. 

The subject is an integral part of 21st century learning. Built within its curriculum and pedagogy are elements of successful 21st century teaching and learning. Students of Political Science excel not just in fields directly connected to the subject, but in diverse fields, given their ability to hold balanced opinions and work in different contexts. This also makes the subject a great choice for transdisciplinary learning, as its concepts and ideas can easily translate to other domains. Fields such as Bioethics, Environmentalism, Space exploration and Colonisation, also need understanding of politics and its skills and knowledge. Any student who has the nuanced and multifaceted understanding that the subject provides will stand apart from the rest and lead the change.
