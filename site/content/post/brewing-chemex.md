title: I give you the absolute freedom to choose me as your supreme leader

description: On Saturday, four days after the Tamil Nadu assembly election, the
  Madras high court made some interesting observations on a public interest
  litigation seeking an instruction to political parties to conduct their
  internal elections before the assembly election. “The petitioner’s sentiment
  has to be respected as it revealed the highest regard for democratic
  principles,” the court said, disposing of the petition which was now
  infructuous since the election had been conducted.

Nothing may come out of such petitions, but they come as occasional reminders of how autocratic our political parties are; they hold a mirror to the reality that the parties that wax eloquent about democracy do not practise it internally. And this is not to say that only those parties accused of practising dynasty politics (and there are plenty of them) are autocratic. In fact, the Congress, which still cannot think beyond the Nehru-Gandhi family for leadership, has a much more liberal intra-party democracy than the BJP. But members of the Congress have used this liberty to foster factionalism that has systematically eaten the innards of the organisation.

The BJP, on the other hand, takes pride in not promoting dynastic succession (though close to 15% of its MPs since 2009 come from BJP families) but its leadership is often handpicked by the RSS or a handful of seniors in the party. The same is the case with virtually every party, where the lower-level units and cadres have no say in the selection of the leadership. The communist parties in the 1980s and 1990s conducted internal polls to select committees, but it turned out to be a farce as often the incumbents introduced ‘official panels’ and those comrades who voted for someone outside the panel were shown the door.
