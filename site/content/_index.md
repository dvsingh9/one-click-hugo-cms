  heading: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra urges people to 'Speak up for vaccine for all'
    initiative
  text: >-
    Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday urged people to
    raise their voices for the "Speak up for vaccine for all" initiative as the
    country is witnessing a continuous surge in Covid-19 cases.

    Sharing a video, the Congress leader tweeted, "Because the vaccine is for everyone. Because the government should pay more attention to the public than organising the events. Because everyone has the right to know where the PM Care funds are being spent. Because instead of exporting the vaccine, the government should focus on vaccinating every citizen."
